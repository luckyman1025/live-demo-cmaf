## Known Issues
Whilst testing the integration between FFmpeg and Unified Origin the following
issues where identified: 

* Audio tracks contain no bitrate information

Unified Origin requires the presence of avgBitrate to be signaled in the esds
box. Currently FFmpeg only signals maxBitrate. Bug/Feature to be raised with
FFlabs as video tracks have both.

* Subtitle support

Currently FFmpeg is unable to create CMAF compliant subtitle tracks. FFmpeg is
able to generate text based subtitles in an fMP4 container. However these are
signaled using a codec id "tx3g" which not supported by Unified Origin. 

* global_sidx

When ``-global_sidx``is enabled with the MP4 muxer, no sidx is present in the
file. Notes on this feature indicate a box should be present ``Write global SIDX
atom. Applicable only for single file, mp4 output, non-streaming mode.``

* libx265 + mp4 muxer

FFmpeg fails to POST any data to Origin when configured to use the ``libx265``
encoder and ``mp4`` muxer. The same configuring using the ``ismv`` muxer works.

* Dual Encoder ingest

Due to the lack of options to time-sync/lock multiple FFmpeg contains, ingesting
streams from different contains/FFmpeg process is not possible. Test of this
identified on average a 1~2 frame delay between process which causing
discontinues and playout issue from origin. Instead multiple streams can be
generated by the single FFmpeg container.
